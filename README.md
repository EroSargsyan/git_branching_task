# Maximum possible swapping
Write a function that makes the first number as large as possible by swapping out its digits for digits in the second number.

 **For example: maxPossible(9328, 456) âžž 9658**

9658 is the largest possible number built from swaps from 456. 3 replaced with 6 and 2 replaced with 5.

The solution you can find [here](maxPossible.js).
